# D3-data-journalism

The current data set inculdes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

I have created a scatter plot between poverty and obesity.

Using the D3 techniques, I have created a scatter plot that represents each state with a circle element. 

*Note: You'll need to use python -m http.server to run the visualization. This will host the page at localhost:8000 in your web browser.
