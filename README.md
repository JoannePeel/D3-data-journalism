# D3-data-journalism

The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

Create a scatter plot between two of the data variables, for example Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.

Using the D3 techniques, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. 

*Note: You'll need to use python -m http.server to run the visualization. This will host the page at localhost:8000 in your web browser.
